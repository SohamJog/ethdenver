## 🚀 How It Works: A Journey of Innovation

1. **Initiate**: Open CrypTap on your device, choose your ETH amount, and hit send. Experience the ease of modern transactions.
2. **Share**: Post-approval, a unique share link is generated. This can be air-dropped using NFC—innovation at its finest.
3. **Secure Verification**: Upon receiving, the link activates an API call to verify the sender's address integrity. Only then does the transaction proceed.
4. **Vault Storage**: The crypto is temporarily stored in a secure vault, accessible only by the receiver. This extra layer of security ensures peace of mind for both parties.

CrypTap is more than an app; it's a new era for cryptocurrency transactions. Embrace the future, where sending crypto is as simple as a handshake. Welcome to CrypTap—where innovation meets convenience.
